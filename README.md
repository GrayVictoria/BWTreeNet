## For user

### GuiTest
GuiTest is used for testing WFV images, contains all the testing strategy as illustrated in our manuscript.
You can use SwissTest.py to map other B&W images.

Besides, if you want to train the B&WTreeNet, just use the model file in /GuiTest/model/BWTreeNet.py
And if you want to get the weight, please contact us.

### Luminance Enhancer
This project is  used for changing the luminance distribution for the B&W images.
We support the weight for our project.

### augmentation
This code is for image augmentation through training, which is based on the albumentation project, but we added more useful new methods.

Some illustrative images will be shown after the article is published.
